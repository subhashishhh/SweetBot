# SweetBot
Confectionery items play a vital role in our lives. A plethora of confectionery items are ordered and consumed during various social gatherings, by a wide range of customers. The order may vary in terms of quantity, type of event and level of specificity. Moreover, some order may contain all the information needed while some may only contain the name of the festival for which suitable items need to be inferred and packaged accordingly. To understand all these intricacies for an automated agent involved in picking and packaging of items requires background knowledge. An automated system can perform these tasks only if, it comprises of a robust internal knowledge representation system. We, thus, propose an ontology for a service robot, SweetBot that defines pertinent concepts applicable to the confectionery domain needed by the robot in order to perform the picking and packaging of sweet items efficiently.
